# POS-ERP-JAVA

This repository contains a graphical user interface (GUI) for a point of sale (POS) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, developed using Java Swing.

## Project Description

The GUI includes features such as product and inventory management, sales and order tracking, and customer management.

Please note that this project is still a work in progress and the GUI is not yet fully functional.

## Installation

To run the GUI, you can download the latest executable file from the [Releases](https://github.com/AnmolDh/POS-ERP-JAVA/releases) section. Choose the appropriate executable for your operating system and simply run it to start the application.

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine, as the application requires Java to run.
